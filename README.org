* Kituu

****  Environment (dotfiles, scripts, binary packages, Emacs and Mozilla extensions so far) installation & update sh (tested w/ BASH and ZSH) script

What do one need on a given computer ? Dotfiles ("hidden"
configuration files in your $HOME dir, names start with a dot, hence
the name. It's a big deal. GNU/Linux works like this), a selection of
packages depending on what I intend to do with that rig. And
emacs. AFAIC, that's it. And there's only so many times a guy can type
"install this", "install that", "mkdir ~/tmp", and many bits that get
painful to do and re-do over time, before doing something about it.

So on *all* my machines, I run this script (heck, even my phone) basically at
boot time.

*NOTA BENE* You can "preview" the script by answering "no" to every
 question, and then get a taste of what would be going on without
 touching anything. The idea here is to answer "Yes" (ENTER) and that
 everything goes smoothly.

*** Features

- Install and maintain the things I (and you too I guess) need on every machine I install :
  - Binary packages (debian - & friends - only, sorry. I mean of course I can detect your distro - in the dark - but every single one has its own package naming scheme, what are you gonna do?)
  - Various scripts from Version Controlled repositories
  - Mozilla (Firefox, Thunderbird, ABrowser, whatever) add-ons
- Manage multiple VC systems
  - GIT
  - SVN
  - BZR
  - CVS
  - Anything that's three-letter named :)
- Allow editing of the files as well as deployment : It's a big deal and it's the whole point of the thing
- Setup a home dir the way I'm used to

*** Installation
    - cd ~/
    - git clone https://github.com/xaccrocheur/kituu.git .kituu && .kituu/scripts/kituu-setup.sh

    Or, to install it and be able to modify it and push back your changes to github (if you're me, for instance)

    - git clone git@github.com:xaccrocheur/kituu.git .kituu && .kituu/scripts/kituu-setup.sh -rw
    - Then run *kituu-setup.sh -rw* afterwards to install your own VC repositories in read-write mode (*kituu-setup.sh* to just update)

**** This will :
    - Clone a repository at ~/.kituu/
    - Backup all existing ~/.dotfile as ~/.dotfile.orig
    - Symlink ~/.kituu/* in ~/*
      - (Now you have a new dir, ~/script/ and it's in your $PATH)
    - Install a selection of packages, sorted by groups: Multimedia, Dev, Music prod, etc. You're asked for each group if you want to install.
    - Generate a local temp web page on the fly, allowing quick install of - the latest version of - my/your selection of Mozilla extensions
    - Update everything to the latest version at each subsequent run
